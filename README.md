### How to install MongoDB using Homebrew
- Here is the link: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/
- Steps to install in terminal (iTerm2):
    - `brew tap mongodb/brew`
    - `brew update`
    - `brew install mongodb-community@7.0` - always double check if 7.0 is the latest stable version
    - Now make sure to set the Mongod process to automatically run in the background using brew services

### MongoDB Commands
- `brew services start mongodb-community@7.0` - Automatically runs `mongod` in the background on computer startup
- `brew services stop mongodb-community@7.0` - Manually terminate `mongod` from running in the background
- `mongosh` - Start the MongoDB Shell
